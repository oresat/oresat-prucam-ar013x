; __timing_routine inserts the required instructions for the compile time 
; defined sample rate. It is based on the SPEED symbol, possible values are:
; - 1: capture loop is for 0-50MHz pixel clock.
; - 2: capture loop is for 33.33MHz-66.66MHz pixel clock.
; - 3: capture loop is for (exactly) 100MHz pixel clock. UNTESTED!

  ; SPEED == 3: capture loop is for 100MHz pixel clock. SPEED=3 inserts no
  ; additional instructions so the capture routine only executes the pixel
  ; capture and the NOP(or control instruction). These 2 instructions take
  ; 10ns, which creates 100MHz sample rate (1/10ns = 100MHz). This is only 
  ; suitable for a pixel clock of exactly 100MHz
  .if SPEED = 3

  ; SPEED == 2: capture loop is for 33.33MHz-66.66MHz pixel clock. This routine
  ; waits for the pixel clock to be high. This routine can capture a pixel
  ; clock maximum of 66.66MHz. This route can capture a minimum pixel clock of
  ; 33.33MHz because it does not wait for the clock to go low. The capture code
  ; will wait for the pixel clock to be high, capture the pixel value, and NOP
  ; (or control instruction). These 3 instructions take a minimum of 15ns 
  ; (5ns * 3), so a pixel clock <33.33MHz would have a high time of greater
  ; than 15ns, which would mean we could potentially re-execute the 
  ; 'WBS R31, CLK_BIT' during the same cycle, screwing up the capture.
  ; Therefore, SPEED=2 is only suitable for 33.33MHz-66.66MHz

  ; and then high, capture the pixel data, and NOP(or control instruction like 
  ; xin/xout transfer, triggering an interrupt, or loop maintenance.). These 4
